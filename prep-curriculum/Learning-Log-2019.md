Learning Log begins April 2019

April 10 3am

So I have been doing the pre curriculum Student prep. Both Tech and Core!
A lot I am familiar with due to briefly starting this course in the past! What I have tried hard to do and learned from this evening is to really gain a sense of forward motion that I am happy with. To gain a feeling confidence to go into orientation with at least some technical understanding. A lot of what I have done practically is the Tech, this to gain the skills needed but after reading through a lot of the material provided for the Core aspects I have been given a great boost in confidence to know that the way I operate when applying myself to new things is actually normal and by recognising these characteristics in myself as being fairly common and normal has made me more aware and also able to find answers or suggestions to help me retrain my way of thinking, acting, doing and learning!

Yesterday/last night I did not start off writing goals and challenges but I know what I set out to achieve tonight and I new my challenges so Ill just tell you now as I  answer the questions I endeavour to ask myself as often as I can every day!

I wanted to get through majority of the tech prep work! 

I wanted that to include all the set up of my email and create new accts needed for foundations. Complete corrospondence with Ollie. 

I wanted to actually understand a heap of Tech and read through All of the setup Core, Pre student prep etc to have a total general knowledge and decide what was best to start with!

I actually achieved all I wanted to and feel great from it!

My challenges I new would be my procrastination and discipline. My focus. My understanding and skill level required to achieve and my lifestyle with kids and other home and work life commitments! 

I waited till I could sit in silence and focus being when kids go downfor sleep. 
I work best at night and I enjoy no distractions! 
I have been up all night but I will get a couple hours sleep now, get up and send my kids to school and get my work load of a few hours done which leaVES ME free to come back after lunch with a fresh approach and start school my work again! I will be ready for orientation easy by tomorrow evening! I am just about done as is!

April 11 - Core reflections

Focus, Neuroplacity, my own traits and bad habbits to hit head on and ideas on how to succeed 
 
 FOCUS REFLECTION

<!-- - I find it difficult to tune out distractions. --> 

This is something I find more difficult than I used to! I used to have what i feel is more focus more drive and more determination thes all helped my acjieve litterally what evr I want to get done! If Im not in the right mood its useless I look for distractions. in general any people and kidsthat break my concentration are def teh main thing I need to avoid. Where as music is not. night time when i am not worried that ill be interupted is when I work best and im very nocturnal by nature. If i procrastinate i get distracted and run out of time. or come across a justifiable replacment job.  If I manage to make a clear mental decision of commitmnent to any task Back before kids there was nothing that could distract me. Now If I make that same mental decision or commitment it means less I often have so little time to focus on one or two main tasks and thats because ihave so  many things on the go with all the aspects of my life that just to get my life half done has become satisfactory. I have bneen self emplloyed and been able to raise and spend alot of time with my children growing up I have had a few un focused years and undefined goals. Since being a single mother I have had even more stresses and obligations to fill not to mention the failing fears that at times take over my ability to do normal adult and life duties. procrastination is my worst enemy during a hard or crap time and it compounds my promblems yet its when i do it worst.

MENTAL RESTRUCTURE REFLECTIONS AND STRATAGIES

Im all ready feeling a change Im already aware of the requirments of this course I found when I was doing foundations last year although not successful in the course I was untroduced to a way of working and thinking methodically that had to happen in order to get through this challenge. It was hard to retrain myself but it felt good and familiar.Back when there was a time when I had no kids and mother obligations, no exsessive rent no other ADULT FUNCTIONALITY demands on me but my own! I have now reached the age where i yern to become something else and i have got the support of my family and friends to make this work out. My children are stoked that i am re enrolled and back at school even though they will hardly see my and ill be stressed at times and grumpy. They truly can give me all the motivaqtion needed just knowing they want for me to succeed as i want for them! Im not worried im excited to find a better balance in life i want more direction and focus and I want to be a coder a developer a designer and a role modle. Im seeing my life alreaddy becoming organised and I have managed to get it together before we start I need to focus on mental perception of tasks and practice the daily mantra of how to see my day ahead for the my positive intentended results. I am going to achieve! I have my space sorted and rules of my space  and time in my mind and discused with those I live with. I have a basic pre study routine that is an aproach that works 95% of the time there is always a day that nothing will help that 5% cater for that andother unexpected circumstances that you cant forsee. I need strengthen my mental staminar again as once apon a time it was ridculously strong.

MY LIFE HAS BEEN NEUROPLACITY I JUST DIDNT KNOW THAT WORD

Neuorplacity is someting I understand without even the need to think! As a hairdresser of 18+ years its with out a doubt connections and practical and mental combos that i practice everyday! Its how I remember my tech theory in such technical detail even now where as I cant remember an email i read yesterday. I learnt with my hands my eyes my brain and my experience, as I did this my ability to read  and retain details to do with complex chemical actions for example was amplified. The Teory satisfied my need for fact and reason and this cemented skills and knowledge in me purley because I could connect to the written aspects sO logically and easily. In general I have never read the paper  It has always annoyed me i hear all the news through clients and friends I would not bother unless a particular intrest i had was mentioned even then Im likely to go the day forgetting or nogt prioritising grabbing a paper to see my article of intrest just simply because Its not something i activly think to do with my time. I watched one link and semi skimmed the others I just know you can achieve so much just with mental commitment add physical and add a personal desire or intrest to your mental drive you xan not fail!

Coding and computers. They to me mean to me THEORY- UNI - STUDY - Reading and typing screen after screen but my intrest in computers has always been there so I now understand why. they are an extreme joint practical and theory venture. Now I have discovered how to structure my aproach I see it as so much more as a creation of what ever I want! Its endles its social its flexible its alot of work or its a satisfaction job once ur skills are able to earn a wage and support a future for a mother and kids!  PREPARE PLAN PRACTICE PLAY PAUSE I have options and I am reqlly really ecxited to feel my brain again.

MOMENTS AND ENERGY BOOSTS Acting and learning in the NOW!

Sporadic decisions and compulsive acvivities have always worked for me i live in the now im resoursful and I am a problem solver weirdly enough! I am able to manage and direct a team or a mission or just organise the functionality and time managment of an under staffed excessivly busy day in the salon with ease yet I cant do ME or MINE I strugle to routine myself but staying calm in a crisis and taking control of decisions in otrhers best intrest makes this learning aspect work for me! I put ino play whats needed to be done. some might need the intruction manual to get people out in a fire drill if you can see my point. im in the moment and logic kicks in to sort it out. I would have visualised it as I was instruted at an earlier date others would remember the words they read or herd with out actioning it mentally this to me is the difference in peoples learning and social interaction ability! This is relative to just in time learning! I often need the basic instruction and Im away laughing! maybe its just the terminiology i dont understand so I get told and then I do understand it all. Maybe its ' it just works dont worry about how' that people struggle with but I dont i just know it worked Ill figure out along the way no doubt why!

One thing I know I have to really get better at is touch typing i think my speed iis ok if i don need to read as i type but thats impossible so Ill learn to touch type as quoick as i can!!


I am going to send these changes and any other repo changes up to git hub thi learning log along with attched scren shots as evidence should cover the prep ciriculum
